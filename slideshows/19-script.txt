Title: What is Juneteenth?

Paragraphs:
Juneteenth (aka Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Liberation Day, and Emancipation Day) is a holiday celebrating the liberation of those who had been held as slaves in the United States.  Originating in Texas, it is now celebrated annually on the 19th of June throughout the United States, with varying official recognition.

Paragraphs:
Specifically, it commemorates Union army general Gordon Granger announcing federal orders in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, proclaiming that all people held as slaves in Texas were free.

However, the Union's Emancipation Proclamation had already officially outlawed slavery in Texas and the other states then in rebellion against the U.S. almost two and a half years earlier.

Paragraphs:
The defeat of the Confederate States army in April 1865 allowed wider enforcement of the proclamation. But Texas was the most remote of the slave states.

With a low presence of Union troops, enforcement there had been slow and inconsistent before Granger's announcement.
